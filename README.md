# AFKVideoLoadRemover
Proper install + tutorial will come soon. More things to work out.

May only work with [this run](https://www.speedrun.com/hzd/run/z5vev0nm) for now as the non-main loading screens (e.g. entering proving) have different backgrounds if players pause at different times. Also only 720p is supported currently.

Follow [this video](https://youtu.be/trXs2r6xSnI) to setup OpenCV 4.6.0 in Visual studio 2022 if you want to try it out early.
