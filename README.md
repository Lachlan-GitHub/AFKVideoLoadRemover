# AFKVideoLoadRemover
Follow [this video](https://youtu.be/trXs2r6xSnI) to setup OpenCV 4.6.0 in Visual studio 2022

Current version consistently returns 7 extra seconds of loads compared to the [Video Load Remover](https://github.com/blegas78/autoSplitters) in the single run that I have tested. There could be some inaccuracy to fix as I tested with a 30fps video + a few seconds of error with the [Video Load Remover](https://github.com/blegas78/autoSplitters)
